"""
Strong Password Detection
Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password
string it is passed is strong.
A strong password is deÔ¨Åned as one that is at least eight characters
long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and has at least
one digit.
You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to
validate its strength.
